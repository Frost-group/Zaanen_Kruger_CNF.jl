Main Julia scripts for the project 

. 2D_backflow_edit_un.jl --> a non-Jupyter notebook version of the 2D_backflow.jl from the Frost research group (https://github.com/Frost-group/Astowell.jl/blob/main/notebooks/2D_backflow.jl)

. Testing_cnf.jl --> Main Continuous Normalising Flows code built on FFJord Algorithm (works in theory)

' Testing_non_cnf.jl --> A small non-CNF neural network I made, works fairly well, but doesn't produce very good models for high alpha
